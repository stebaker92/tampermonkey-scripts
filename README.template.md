# Tampermonkey User Scripts

Some basic TamperMonkey scripts I've created to learn TamperMonkey for both personal use and software development helpers. This repo also has a few scripts to lint & to auto-update this readme. The readme displays a list of all public scripts with links to install the latest version & a brief description too. 

Issues & Pull requests are welcome!
